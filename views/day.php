 * a day.php file in a tribe-events/ directory within your theme directory, which
 * will override the /views/day.php. 
 *
 * You can use any or all filters included in this file or create your own filters in 
 * your functions.php. In order to modify or extend a single filter, please see our
 * readme on templates hooks and filters (TO-DO)
